# Classes at Penn
Since I only really transitioned to data science in the last 5 years from my jobs in consulting, I don‚Äôt have direct advice for Penn classes beyond the intro stats and comp sci classes. It definitely looks to me like STAT 111, STAT 112, and CIS120 are important prereqs.

The <a href="https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/data-science-minor/">comp sci catalog</a> for Penn's data science minor looks solid.

If you do nail those initial stats classes, you might be able to get into some of the epi and biostats courses in the School of Medicine in your junior or senior year. Definitely ask with an HSOC major advisor or someone in SoM to check if they will plausibly let you in as an upperclassmen to some of the biostats (BSTA) classes so long as you‚Äôve fulfilled some prereqs. If they let you in the class, I am almost certain HSOC will let you count it toward your major.
ECON/HCMG 236 is great if you end up doing more economics, but it is very much not an intro course. I also took this global health class (PUBH519) and counted it to HSOC, which was mixed methods (not hardcore data sci at all) but it is very policy-oriented and super interesting.
If you can‚Äôt get into the BSTA classes but they let you into some of PUBH ones, definitely do those. Intro to biostats would probably be redundant with some of your STAT courses, but Intro to Epi (PUBH502) would not and you will almost certainly find the math is easier in classical epi. From a quick look at this, the most relevant classes to health data science would be
-	PUBH517 ‚Äì if you want to do geographic mapping and GIS data
-	PUBH521 ‚Äì evaluation is one of the main applications of health data sci (and I am squarely in it), although you should check if this one actually includes quant methods
-	PUBH605 ‚Äì defo see some biostats/modelling tools implied there
-	PUBH610 ‚Äì infectious disease modelling, i.e. using math to simulate germs; I gave a gentle intro talk to NHS colleagues on these tools that you can see here
I sort of work in the outer halos of a rockstar statistician/data scientist named Luke Keele in Perelman, who actually is a quant political scientist by background. And as mentioned, I cite Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen and Paul Rosenbaum a fair amount, who are both ‚Äúfamous‚Äù and BFDs in the world of statistics (we‚Äôre really introverted, you will never hear of any of us üòä). I don‚Äôt necessarily expect any of these profs teach undergrad classes ‚Äì just mentioning their names in case a random public talk or seminar happens so you might be able to attend and get a sense for the academic side of hardcore data sci, which to be clear is way more complicated and cutting-edge than the vast majority of commercial and policy-relevant data science. Penn in general attracts a lot of hyper-talented applied statisticians so there are more names out there ‚Äì definitely recommend sneaking into public talks or workshops if the opportunity arises.
This is not really undergrad level but there are public open seminars given by some of these folks and similar in my world of ‚Äúcausal inference‚Äù, organised by the Stanford stats department: https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/past-talks-and-recordings?authuser=0


# Health-focused data science taster courses (Coursera, edX etc)
1.	A very decent-looking course on applied health data science using Python (Edinburgh): https://www.coursera.org/learn/datascimed#syllabus
2.	This one from MIT might also be in Python as well as R? https://www.edx.org/course/collaborative-data-science-for-healthcare
3.	A gentle introduction to stats epi and health data sci (Imperial College London, R): https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-statistics-data-analysis-public-health. See also https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistical-analysis-r-public-health
4.	A more intensive biostats-oriented data science course (Johns Hopkins, R): https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics
5.	The longer list here is actually not bad either: https://www.classcentral.com/tag/health-data-analysis
Learning general data science, roughly in ascending order of complexity 
1.	Good interactive package to learn R: https://swirlstats.com/ and see https://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/
2.	Andrew Ng‚Äôs very highly regarded intro to ML course (Stanford): https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
3.	A generalist data science course (Johns Hopkins biostats faculty, taught in R, extending the class above): https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r
4.	Excellent open textbook in R, specifically Tidyverse (nb if Python and R are the two most common languages of data science, Tidyverse is a very different dialect to base R): https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
5.	Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ (used to be for peer learning competitions, now has all sorts of resources from course content to message boards). It is okay to learn from hackathons but I would definitely recommend doing an intro course first so you can contribute some code/knowledge on how to build stuff.
6.	A textbook on time series forecasting, which is one of the methods I use: https://otexts.com/fpp2/
7.	Another excellent open textbook: https://www.statlearning.com/

Commentaries (understanding ‚Äòwhat is and isn‚Äôt data science‚Äô rather than the mechanics of how to do it):
1.	‚ÄúStatistics as a science, not an art: the way to survive in data science‚Äù (Mark van der Laan, Berkeley): https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/02/01/statscience_feb2015/
2.	‚ÄúBeyond the hype: big data concepts, methods, and analytics‚Äù (Gandomi & Haider): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007
3.	A sensibly skeptical view of unthoughtful or underregulated AI: https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/
4.	A nice lighthearted book about what AI does, and its very real and hilarious limitations by an expert who makes them: https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing
